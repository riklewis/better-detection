# Better Detection
Improve the security of your website by detecting unexpected changes to content

This plugin will create and store hashes of content (eg. posts, pages, etc.) and monitor these moving forwards in order to detect when changes occur.  When changes are made outside of the normal working process, such as a direct database update, this will then be detected as the hash will get out of sync with the content.
